OMPW provides an abstraction layer for writing Lisp libraries
that can be used in "pure" Common Lisp, but also in the OpenMusic
or PWGL environments.

It defines a macro DEFINE-BOX that expands differently
depending on the current system being used.

For instance

(define-box myadd ((a 1) (b 1))
  "Add A + B."
  (+ a b))

will become:

In pure Common Lisp:

(progn (export 'myadd)
       (defgeneric myadd (a b))
       (defmethod myadd (a b) "add a + b." (+ a b)))

In OM:

(progn (export 'myadd)
       (om::defmethod! myadd (a b)
	 :doc "Add A + B."
	 :initvals '(1 1)
	 :icon 128
	 (+ a b)))

In PWGL:

(progn (export 'myadd)
       (system::pwgldef myadd ((a '1) (b '1))
			"add a + b."
			nil
			(+ a b)))

See the file examples.lisp for more options.

The OMPW library can be loaded by using ASDF <http://www.cliki.net/asdf>
or by simply loading load.lisp.

Bug reports, comments etc. are, of course, welcome.

Have fun,
